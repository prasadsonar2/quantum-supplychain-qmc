# quantum-supplychain-qmc
Simulation code and research paper demonstrating the application of Quantum Markov Chains (QMC) to model inventory dynamics and risk propagation in multi-echelon supply chain systems. Includes entropy-based uncertainty modeling, Kraus operators, time-delay effects, and node-level noise for realistic logistics behavior.
