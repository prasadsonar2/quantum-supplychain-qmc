## Abstract

This paper presents a quantum-inspired framework for simulating inventory dynamics and risk propagation in multi-echelon supply chains using **Quantum Markov Chains (QMCs)**. It introduces density matrix-based inventory representation, entropy-driven uncertainty measurement, and noise operators to simulate stochastic transitions. Features such as lead time delays, node-specific decoherence, and feedback-based replenishment decisions are modeled. The approach is relevant for digital twin simulations, supply chain forecasting, and resilience analysis.
